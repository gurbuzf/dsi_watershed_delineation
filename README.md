Watershed Delineation Tool :sweat_drops:

Developed for the [Turkish State Hydraulic Services (DSI)](https://www.dsi.gov.tr/).

## Description

This tool facilitates the batch processing of pour points, allowing for the on-demand extraction of drainage areas for multiple points.

This Python package has been specifically designed and tested for delineating watersheds in Turkiye. However, with the provision of the necessary data, it can also be utilized for other locations worldwide.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
1. (Recommended!) Create and activate a virtual environment, using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) or [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20virtual%20environment,virtualenv%20in%20the%20below%20commands.&text=The%20second%20argument%20is%20the,project%20and%20call%20it%20env%20.).
1. Install required libraries.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```sh
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

4. Running the code using a user-defined configuration file.:

```sh
python run.py --config_path=configuration.ini
```
## Data

To be updated!

<!-- - Hydrologicaly conditioned MERIT DEM with approximately 90 meter pixel resolution.
    - 8 digit drainage/flow direction data calculated by QGIS Grass.
    - Flow Accumulation Data calculated by QGIS Grass.
- Vector data produced by GD of Turkish Water Management.
     - Shapefile of the 25 watershed boundaries in EPSG4326 projection.
     - Shapefile of Countrywide River Network in EPSG4326 projection. -->

## Features

## Examples

- Examples are provided in the **'/examples'** folder. Please thoroughly review them and run at least one to test your working environment before proceeding with your data.
  - After cloning the repository and installing the requirements.txt,execute the following script. Ensure that you are in the cloned directory named **_'/path/to/directory/watt-watershed-delineation-tool'_**.
 

    ```sh
    python run.py --config_path=examples/ex_1/config_ex1.ini
    ```

- Feel free to experiment with the optional parameters in the configuration fileâ€”it's highly recommended for a more customized experience!

## Acknowledgemet

- Prior to initiating this project, I invested time in comprehending the source code available on GitHub at [https://github.com/mheberger/delineator](https://github.com/mheberger/delineator), associated with [Global Watersheds Web App (mghydro)](https://mghydro.com/watersheds/). While this app impressed me with its exceptional speed, user-friendliness, and accuracy, I had to develop a new tool tailored to our specific needs. Although mghydro and WATT share limited similarities, I found inspiration in mghydro's architecture, influencing the shaping of WATT.

- :rocket: ChatGPT :rocket: has played an active role in writing docstrings and enhancing the code. Unfortunately, the ChatGPT sometimes reflects its creators' political biases in its responses, rather than adhering strictly to widely accepted and historical facts (e.g., occupied Palestine). Nevertheless, it remains a useful/powerful tool for writing, reviewing, and documenting code. Use with :warning:.

- Many thanks to colleagues at DSI for providing feedback on the accuracy of WATT's outputs.

## Future Work

- An executable (.exe) for this console application.

- A web application would be :gem:!
